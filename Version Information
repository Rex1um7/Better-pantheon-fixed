04-10-2022 (Initial Prototype)
Very, very basic version; functional but crude 

06-10-2022 (Version 0.1)
Complete rebuild of the entire Beliefs.json from the ground up, additional buildings added; general rework of religion in general.

07-10-2022 (Version 0.3 initial release)
Let's. Heccin. GOOOOOOOOOO-!

Known issues: Images need compiling, none of the Wonders have quotes yet, whatever Day Zero fixes I'll be doing once I get all this in game.

08-10-2022 (Version 0.4) 
*Numerous* bugs squashed; wasn't incriminating that because I was going through builds too quickly
Incrementing to 0.4 because I added a modOptions.json to (hopefully) remove the depricated Beliefs.
Now if only I knew why half of the things don't show up, and why the buy with faith stuff isn't showing up.

11-10-2022 (Version 0.4.1)
Fixed "a metric ton" of uncaught errors because the mod test *doesn't test things against the stock rulesets automatically like it should* 
Hopefully things will *mostly* actually *work* now.

13-10-2022 (Version 0.4.2)
Fixed *more* uncaught errors (thanks to carriontrooper for nailing a couple of those)
Attempting to make the extra Beliefs when founding and enhancing religions actually work by putting them in modOptions; the original workaround
that modified the Palace has been depricated.

13-10-2023 (Version 0.4.3) (later in the day)
Restored palace modification *with the right syntax this time;* now actually working as intended.
That's enough to increment by itself. Getting closer to not having any glitches in the base package lads!
Unfortunately I also had to remove Religious Practice because *apparently* you can't put follower beliefs in with just Pantheon level religions
For some reason.  * Confused face *

15-10-2022 (Version 0.4.4)
Squashed minor syntax error in Sacred Seas that wasn't calling Crab correctly, should work now.

12-11-2022 (Version 0.4.5)
Fixed spelling error in Harmonious Existence, should be able to actually build Shangri La now.

12-11-2022 (Version 0.5) (TwoHoursLater.jpg)
Updated all the Gods with special effects. Stand by for bug smashing.

12-11-2022 (Version 0.5.1) (A_Short_Time_Later.jpg)
Syntax error with Love God's mechanic squashed. Initial mechanics for God of Protection, Goddess of Protection, and Goddess of War changed, as the initial thoughts didn't work as was.
All systems should now function (other than images, naturally.)
(Also on that note I fixed a couple that were still the beeg 500x500+ images, into 80x80 like the rest.)

12-11-2022 (Version 0.5.2) (AnotherTwoHoursLater.jpg)
Fixed previously uncaught name mismatches in God of Craftsman and Ceremonial Burial that keept you from being able to buy their respective buildings.

13-11-2022 (Version 0.5.3)
Squashed *yet another* uncaught name mismatch, in pilgrimage this time. Hopefully I won't find many more of these, arg.

14-11-2022 (Version 0.5.4)
*Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrggggghhhhhhhhhh*
(more name mismatches fixed.)

16-11-2022 (Version 0.5.5)
Fixed previously uncaught errors in the environment shrines that made them not work right. Should work as intended now.

04-12-2022 (Version 0.6)
MAJOR UPDATE: restored original building restrictions to Religious Wonders now that the necessary Unique is using buildingFilter properly
This has also necessarily required some minor background tweaking; as follows:
* Enhancer specific Pilgrimage buildings are not National Wonders anymore because you can build more than one of them as originally intended; looking for solutions to make those properly interact with the standard Wonder mechanics at this time,
* Founder specific Religious World Wonders are no longer restricted to Holy Cities (which, yes, means you can now build more than one per civ)
* Founder Beliefs also now give access to a Religious Wonder (as you have to have at least one to build a Religious World Wonder)
We have also changed the Basic set from only enhancing Shrines to enhancing all Agnostic Religious buildings (the vanilla ones, in other words),
And have added a Science version (Natural Philosophy/Theology) and a new building to go with it (the Sage's Lodge) so be aware of that option.

Stand by for day zero bug fixing.

05-12-2023 (Version 0.5.6)
Rolled back use of restrictions, because it's still not working
In that the mod test no longer throws a snit, but the game itself does and crashes whenever you open a city menu.
